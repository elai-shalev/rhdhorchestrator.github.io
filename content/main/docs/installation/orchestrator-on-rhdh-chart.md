For environments where the RHDH Operator is not available, or to have more control on the deployment, you can install the Orchestrator plugin using Helm charts.

To install Orchestrator via the RHDH Helm chart, please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/rhdhorchestrator/rhdh-chart/tree/main/charts/backstage#:~:text=Installing%20RHDH%20with%20Orchestrator%20on%20OpenShift).
