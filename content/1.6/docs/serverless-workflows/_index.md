A serverless workflow in Orchestrator refers to a sequence of operations that run in response to user input (optional) and produce output (optional) without requiring any ongoing management of the underlying infrastructure. The workflow is executed automatically, and frees users from having to manage or provision servers. This simplifies the process by allowing the focus to remain on the logic of the workflow, while the infrastructure dynamically adapts to handle the execution.
